This is the class interface for the various Time Warp centralized
event setimplementations that are available in the Simulation
kernel. The specific event set implementation is hidden from the
other components of the simulation kernel by the aggregation of
the event set implemetations in this class interface (factory
pattern).  All Centralized event set implementations must be
derived from the TimeWarpCentralizedEventSet abstract base class.
