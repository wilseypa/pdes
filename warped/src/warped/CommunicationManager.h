/** The CommunicationManager abstract base class.

 This is the abstract base class for all communication manager
 implementations in the kernel. Different communication manager
 implementations MUST be derived from this abstract base class.

 To accomodate communication related optimizations in the the
 simulation kernel, we define the CommunicationManager abstract
 interface class.  This class provides the basic communication
 facilities and makes certain functions pure virtual so that
 different communication managers may optimize these functions.
 Currently, two communication manager implementations are
 supported: (a) the default communication manager (without any
 optimizations); and (b) the message aggregating communication
 manager that aggregates messages before sending them across the
 network.
