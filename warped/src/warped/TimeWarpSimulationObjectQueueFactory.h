/** The TimeWarpSimulationObjectQueueFactory class.

    This is the class interface for the various Time Warp object queue
    implementations that are available in the Simulation kernel. The
    specific object container implementation is hidden from the other
    components of the simulation kernel by the aggregation of the
    object container implemetations in this class interface ( factory
    pattern).  All object container implementations must be derived from the
    TimeWarpSimulationObjectQueue abstract base class.
