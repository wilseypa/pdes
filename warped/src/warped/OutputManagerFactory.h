    This is the class interface for the various output events manager
    implementations that are available in the Simulation kernel. The
    specific output events manager implementation is hidden from the
    other components of the simulation kernel by the aggregation of
    the output manager implemetations in this class interface
    ( factory pattern).  All output events manager
    implementations must be derived from the OutputManager abstract
    base class. The choices are: AggressiveOutputManager,
    LazyOutputManager, and AdaptiveOutputManager.
